# Face Detection

#### Implementing a face detection algorithm using a combination of Faster R-CNN, SSD (Single Shot Detection) and YOLO (You Only Look Once)

Trying to make a face detection algorithm based in the three algorithms of object detection above, to make a robust algorithm of face detection

## Roadmap

- [x] Implement Faster R-CNN
- [x] Implement SSD
- [x] Implement YOLO

- [x] Training the algorithm

- [x] Validate

- [x] Working :D
